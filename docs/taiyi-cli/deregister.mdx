# Deregistration

## Current Status

The `deregister` command is not currently implemented in the Taiyi CLI tool. To deregister as an operator, you will need to interact directly with the smart contracts.

## Planned Implementation

A dedicated deregister command is planned for future releases of the Taiyi CLI. This command will provide a convenient way to:

- Deregister validators from the Taiyi Middleware
- Remove operator registration from operator sets
- Complete the necessary cleanup operations

## Manual Deregistration

In the meantime, if you need to deregister from the Taiyi AVS:

1. Use standard Ethereum tools to interact with the relevant contracts:
   - Use ethers.js, web3.js, or other Ethereum libraries
   - Interact directly with the Taiyi EigenLayer Middleware contract

2. Important considerations:
   - Ensure all active duties are completed
   - Withdraw any pending rewards
   - Complete any ongoing validations before deregistering
