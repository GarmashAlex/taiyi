# Deposit

## Current Status

The `deposit` command is not currently implemented in the Taiyi CLI tool. To deposit strategy tokens into a Taiyi AVS, you will need to interact directly with the smart contracts.

## Planned Implementation

A dedicated deposit command is planned for future releases of the Taiyi CLI. This command will provide a convenient way to:

- Deposit tokens into specified strategies
- Approve token transfers
- Monitor deposit transactions

## Manual Deposit Process

In the meantime, if you need to deposit strategy tokens:

1. Use standard Ethereum tools to interact with the strategy contracts:
   - Use ethers.js, web3.js, or other Ethereum libraries
   - First approve the Strategy Manager contract to spend tokens
   - Then deposit tokens into the specified strategy

2. Contract Information:
   - Check the current documentation or ask the team for the latest contract addresses
   - Verify you're using the correct network (Mainnet/Holesky/etc.)

3. Token Requirements:
   - Ensure you have sufficient underlying tokens
   - Amount should be specified in wei (10^18 for most tokens)
   - Check token decimals before depositing
