There are two ways available to a user to send preconf requests namely Type A & Type B.

- Type A: Preconf request is sent to Taiyi preconfirmer directly.
- Type B: First reserve blockspace on a particular slot and then send the preconf request later when the slot arrives.

<Note>
Check out the examples for each type of requests [here](https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi/tree/dev/examples).
