## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

* Completed the [system requirements](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/system_requirements)

* An Ethereum validator node on the Holesky testnet

## Dependencies

First, install Rust using rustup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

> **Tips**- During installation, when prompted, enter `1` for the default installation.
>
> - After Rust installation completes, try running `cargo version` . If it cannot
>   be found, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`. After that, running `cargo version` should return the version, for example `cargo 1.68.2`.
>
> - It's generally advisable to append `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to `~/.bashrc`.

With Rust installed, follow the instructions below to install dependencies relevant to your
operating system:

* **Ubuntu**: `apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential`

* **macOS**: `brew install llvm pkg-config`

* **Windows**: `choco install llvm` or `winget install LLVM.LLVM`

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is 1.82.0. If you already have a version of Rust installed,
you can check your version by running `rustc --version`. To update your version of Rust, run `rustup update`.

## 1. Configure Your Validator

### Update Relay Configuration

For example, with Lighthouse beacon node:

```bash
lighthouse beacon \
    --builder=https://relay.holesky.luban.wtf \
    ...# your other config
```

<Note>
  For a complete list of relay and gateway endpoints, see the [Supported Endpoints](/network_info/supported_endpoints) page.
</Note>

## 2. Register with Taiyi Protocol

### Install Taiyi CLI

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
cargo build --release --bin taiyi-cli
```
 
<Note>
  For detailed information about other commands, see the [Taiyi-CLI](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/taiyi_cli).
</Note>

## Next Steps

With your node components installed and configured, you're ready to proceed to the [Protocol Opt-in](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/protocol_opt_in) process where you'll:

1. Deposit stake into EigenLayer's strategy contract

2. Register as a Taiyi operator

3. Delegate your validator keys to the Gateway

4. Verify your registration and stake
