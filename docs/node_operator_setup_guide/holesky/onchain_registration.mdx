## 1. Deposit Stake

Before depositing into the EigenLayer strategy contract, ensure you have sufficient WETH tokens in your account. You can check your WETH balance on Holesky testnet at [Etherscan](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848#readContract).

To check your balance:
1. Go to the WETH contract on Etherscan
2. Navigate to the "Read Contract" tab
3. Find the `balanceOf` function
4. Enter your wallet address
5. Click "Query" to see your balance

If you need to acquire WETH:
1. First obtain some Holesky ETH from a faucet
2. Convert your ETH to WETH by interacting with the WETH contract


First, you need to deposit WETH into the EigenLayer strategy contract. This stake serves as collateral for your node's operations.

```bash
# Convert ETH to WETH first if needed
# Then approve and deposit WETH
taiyi-cli deposit \
  --execution-rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com \
  --strategy-address <WETH_STRATEGY_ADDRESS> \
  --amount <AMOUNT> \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --strategy-manager-address <STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS>
```

<Note>
You can find the Holesky deployed addresses in [Contract Addresses](/network_info/contract_addresses):
- WETH Strategy: `0x80528D6e9A2BAbFc766965E0E26d5aB08D9CFaF9`
- Strategy Manager: `0xdfB5f6CE42aAA7830E94ECFCcAd411beF4d4D5b6`

  ```rust
#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
pub struct DepositCommand {
    /// The RPC URL of the Ethereum node
    #[clap(long, env = "EXECUTION_RPC_URL")]
    execution_rpc_url: String,

    /// The strategy contract address
    #[clap(long, env = "STRATEGY_ADDRESS")]
    strategy_address: Address,

    /// Amount to deposit
    #[clap(long, env = "AMOUNT")]
    amount: U256,

    /// Private key for signing transactions
    #[clap(long, env = "PRIVATE_KEY")]
    private_key: String,

    /// The strategy manager contract address
    #[clap(long, env = "STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS")]
    strategy_manager_address: Address,
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Contract Interfaces">
  ```solidity
  interface IERC20 {
      function approve(
          address spender, 
          uint256 amount
      ) external returns (bool);
  }

  interface IStrategyManager {
      function depositIntoStrategy(
          address strategy,
          address token,
          uint256 amount
      ) external returns (uint256 shares);
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

This command:
1. Approves the Strategy Manager to spend your WETH
2. Deposits WETH into the EigenLayer strategy
3. Records your stake in the protocol

## 2. Register as Operator

After staking, register yourself into the Taiyi protocol. This step establishes your identity in the protocol.

*Source: [EigenLayer AVS Book - Operators](https://eigenlabs.gitbook.io/avs-book/learn/eigenlayer-a-visual-guide/actors/operators)*

<Note>
Before registering as a Taiyi operator, you must first register as an EigenLayer operator. If you have already staked in Step 1, you will be automatically self-delegated as an operator. 

According to the [EigenLayer documentation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction): 

*"an address can function as both a Restaker, engaging in either liquid or native restaking, and as an Operator simultaneously... Most Operators will receive token delegations sourced from other Restakers within the network, otherwise Operators can choose to self-delegate by allocating their restaked token balance."*

</Note>

```bash
taiyi-cli register-validator \
  --execution-rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --salt 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  --avs-directory-address <AVS_DIRECTORY_ADDRESS> \
  --taiyi-avs-address <TAIYI_VALIDATOR_AVS_ADDRESS>
```

<Note>
You can find the Holesky deployed addresses in [Contract Addresses](/network_info/contract_addresses):
- AVS Directory: `0x055733000064333CaDDbC92763c58BF0192fFeBf`
- Taiyi Validator AVS: `0x3b9b6a197ED476bf784b451b219aD52f71913bC9`
</Note>

<Accordion title="Code">
  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug, Parser)]
  pub struct RegisterCommand {
      /// rpc url
      #[clap(long, env = "EXECUTION_RPC_URL")]
      pub execution_rpc_url: String,

    /// Private key in hex format
    #[clap(long, env = "PRIVATE_KEY")]
    pub private_key: String,

    #[clap(long, env = "SALT")]
    pub salt: B256,

    #[clap(long, env = "AVS_DIRECTORY_ADDRESS")]
    pub avs_directory_address: Address,

    #[clap(long, env = "TAIYI_AVS_ADDRESS")]
    pub taiyi_avs_address: Address,
}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Contract Interfaces">
  ```solidity
  interface IAVSDirectory {
      function calculateOperatorAVSRegistrationDigestHash(
          address operator,
          address avs,
          bytes32 salt,
          uint256 expiry
      ) external view returns (bytes32);
  }

  interface ITaiyiAVS {
      function registerOperatorToAVS(
          address operator,
          SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory signatureWithSaltAndExpiry
      ) external;
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

This command:
1. Creates a registration signature with the AVS Directory
2. Registers your operator address with Taiyi AVS
3. Links your stake to the Taiyi service

## 3. Delegate Validator Keys

Finally, delegate your validator keys to the Taiyi Gateway. This allows your validator to participate in the network.

  --path /path/to/validators \
  --password-path /path/to/secrets
```

<Note>
For additional key source options and detailed usage of the delegate command, see the [Taiyi CLI Delegate Command](/taiyi-cli/delegate) documentation.

<Accordion title="Code">
  ```rust
#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
pub struct DelegateCommand {
    /// Relay url
    #[clap(long, env = "RELAY_URL")]
    pub relay_url: Url,
    /// Relay request timeout
    #[clap(long, env = "RELAY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT", default_value = "30")]
    pub relay_request_timeout: u64,
    /// Preconfer BLS public key
    #[clap(long, env = "GATEWAY_PUBKEY")]
    pub gateway_pubkey: String,
    /// Chain Network
    #[clap(long, env = "NETWORK", default_value = "mainnet")]
    pub network: Network,
    /// The action to perform, delegate or revoke
    #[clap(long, env = "ACTION", default_value = "delegate")]
    pub action: Action,
    /// The source of the private key.
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    pub source: KeySource,
}
```
</Accordion>

This step follows the `/constraints/v0/builder/delegate` endpoint specification from the [Preconfirmations API](https://github.com/ethereum-commitments/constraints-specs/blob/main/specs/preconf-api.md#endpoint-constraintsv0builderdelegate) to perform the gateway delegation. The process involves:

1. Proposer (your validator) electing the Gateway through delegation
2. Gateway managing preconfirmation constraints
3. Relay coordinating between proposer, gateway, and builder
4. Builder receiving constraints and submitting compliant blocks

## 4. Verification

After completing registration:

1. Check your stake:
```bash
taiyi-cli query-stake \
  --execution-rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com \
  --address <YOUR_ADDRESS>
```

<Accordion title="Code">
  Source: [`crates/cli/src/commands.rs`](https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi/blob/main/crates/cli/src/commands/query.rs)
  ```rust
  pub struct QueryStakeCommand {
      execution_rpc_url: String,
      address: Address,
  }
  ```

  **Contract Functions**:
  ```solidity
  function getDeposits(address account) external view returns (
      address[] memory strategies,
      uint256[] memory shares
  );
  ```
</Accordion>

2. Verify registration:
```bash
taiyi-cli query-registration \
  --execution-rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com \
  --address <YOUR_ADDRESS>
```

<Accordion title="Code">
  Source: [`crates/cli/src/commands.rs`](https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi/blob/main/crates/cli/src/commands/query.rs)
  ```rust
  pub struct QueryRegistrationCommand {
      execution_rpc_url: String,
      address: Address,
  }
  ```

  **Contract Functions**:
  ```solidity
  function getOperatorStatus(address operator) external view returns (
      bool isRegistered,
      uint256 validatorCount
  );
  ```
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

After registration, set up [monitoring](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/monitoring).
